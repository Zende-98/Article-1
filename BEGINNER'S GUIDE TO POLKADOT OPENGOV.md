# BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO POLKADOT OPENGOV

What is Polkadot's OpenGov Governance?

OpenGov is Polkadot's decentralized system that empowers every DOT holder to participate in decision-making regarding the blockchain's evolution. OpenGov is a major asset for Polkadot, as it allows the blockchain to constantly evolve and adapt to the community's diverse needs. It's a guarantee of transparency and democracy to continue building Web3.

How to Participate?

There are two ways to participate in OpenGov governance:

1.  Submitting proposals
2.  Voting

    Submitting a Proposal

To submit a proposal, you must first ensure that it is clear and precise about the desired change for the blockchain. It's important to include all necessary technical details and examples to fully support the proposal. Before submitting a proposal, it is recommended to read and study existing proposals to avoid duplicates.

Then, the proposal must be submitted to the community through a dedicated platform, such as Polkassembly, which facilitates the submission and tracking of OpenGov proposals. It is important to carefully follow the instructions provided on the platform to correctly submit the proposal.

On Polkassembly, for example, you need to create an account (if you don't already have one) and connect your wallet containing DOTs to deposit the required amount as a security deposit to submit your proposal.

Polkassembly also offers useful resources and examples of existing proposals, which greatly simplifies the submission process.

Finally, after submission, comes the crucial step of seeking approval for the proposal. To do this, it is essential to share it widely on various communication channels of the community to raise awareness and gather the necessary support for it to be finally submitted to the votes.

 Voting

Voting in OpenGov is open to all DOT holders. It's an opportunity to make your voice heard and contribute to the future of Polkadot. Before voting "for" or "against" a proposal, it is strongly advised to learn about the potential advantages and disadvantages of this proposal for the development of Polkadot.

Voting takes place over a specific period, which is usually announced in advance and may vary depending on the nature or importance of the proposal and the changes it seeks to bring.

To vote, you must connect your wallet to a platform such as Polkassembly and lock the DOTs you own in your wallet for the duration of the vote. It is important to note that the weight of your vote is proportional to the number of DOT tokens you own and choose to lock during the voting period.

Once the voting period is over, comes the final stage of counting the votes, where the results are tallied and published. The results are publicly available on the blockchain.

Important Note: For a proposal to be adopted and implemented, it must obtain a majority of votes and reach the required participation threshold.

These are the two ways to contribute to shaping the future of Polkadot through OpenGov.
